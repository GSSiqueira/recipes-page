            <p>This webpage was made as a backup of my favorite recipes from my favorite sources. <strong>All credits to them</strong>.</p>
            <p>Every source page will be linked in the recipe in the <strong>source</strong> field in the <strong>Details</strong> section.</p>
            <p>Some minor modifications have been made in some recipes mainly due to not having the exact same ingredient here in Brasil (when the recipe comes from other country). Other recipes have been altered just for my own preferences.</p>
            <p>There are not goint to be too many recipes here. I'm doing this just as an educational project to learn to build webpages. Therefore it's not goint to be extremely optimized and probably not even going to have a dedicated server.</p>
